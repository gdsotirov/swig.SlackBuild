swig:
swig: SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in
swig: C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages. SWIG is
swig: used with different types of languages including common scripting
swig: languages such as Perl, Python, Tcl/Tk and Ruby. The list of supported
swig: languages also includes non-scripting languages such as C#, Common Lisp
swig: (Allegro CL), Java, Modula-3 and OCAML. Also several interpreted and
swig: compiled Scheme implementations (Chicken, Guile, MzScheme) are
swig: supported. SWIG is most commonly used to create high-level interpreted
swig: or compiled programming environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for
swig: testing and prototyping C/C++ software. SWIG can also export its parse
swig: tree in the form of XML and Lisp s-expressions. SWIG may be freely used,
swig: distributed, and modified for commercial and non-commercial use.
